This 25 cm thick unit is calcareous with a platy structure and grades upwards into a greenish grey blocky mudstone with some organics. This third unit encloses the upper portion of the sedimentary structure (figure 2a,d ) and bears a sharp, irregular contact with an overlying burrowed dark red claystone...The lithology of the structure contrasts sharply with the surrounding host mudrock and facilitates recognition of the structure in the field (figure 2). The lower, bone-bearing portion consists of 25–30 cm of medium to fine, calcareous greenish-grey sandstone, moderately sorted with abundant plagioclase and other volcanogenic grains (figure 2d ). Small (3–6 mm), rounded mud clasts are common in the coarser basal portion. This structureless unit fines upwards with an increasing clay content. A thin, 1–2 cm thick, grey claystone separates this lower sand- stone from an upper fine sandstone. The bedding parallels that of the host mudrocks. Reduced clay content, grey colour and larger (approx. 10 mm), platy mud clasts distinguish this unit from the otherwise similar, lower sandstone.

However, the bone of the specimen is dark brown, not the greenish-gray of typical Hornerstown bone. Furthermore, Gallagher (1993) suggested that the bone-producing horizon at Barnsboro was in the Navesink.

The Two Medicine Formation is about 650 m thick and consists primarily of mudstones, siltstones, and fine-grained lenticular sandstones, interbedded with bentonites of varying thickness (Dawson 1885; Stebinger 1914; Rogers et al. 1993). The Upper Two Medicine has been dated by Rogers et al. (1993) using radioisotopes at 74 Ma (10 m below top of formation), an age accepted by Eberth (1997) and Trexler (2001). The top of the Dinosaur Park Formation was given an age of 74-74.5 Ma by Eberth (1997), but of 75 Ma or older by Hamblin (1994). Eberth (2005) refined this to around 74.9 Ma. Thus, the uppermost Two Medicine sediments are slightly younger than the latest Dinosaur Park beds.","The specimen described here, MOR 433, was found disarticulated in a grey siltstone",gray,,terrestrial indet.,,,,,,,,
